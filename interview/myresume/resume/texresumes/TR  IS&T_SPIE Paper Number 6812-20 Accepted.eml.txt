Dear Dr. Rolin,
Dear Professor Prêteux,

Please, find attached some good news: our paper including some of Ashutosh
results has been accepted for Electronic Imaging 2008.
Of course, this means for Ashutosh some more experiments to do but I am
quite confident he will confirm the very good impression he gave us.
With my highest consideration,
Mihai
